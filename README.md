# Sudoku Solver (Python)

This repository is just for me personally to get more familiar with Python.

Install required dependencies with pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running tests

Run the tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

```bash
python -m pytest
```
